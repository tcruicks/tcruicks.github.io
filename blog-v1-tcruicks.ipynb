    "Maintaining adequate world food supply at affordable cost requires optimizing agricultural productivity across vast areas of farm land.  Large farms attempt to maximize their productivity using various technologies that provide data down to the square meter of land.  The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a commonly used remotely sensed index that provides data on the \"greenness\" or health of crop vegetation. However, the NDVI index is a lagging indicator of crop stress because water and/or heat stress occurs prior to the degradation of vegetation greenness.<br>\n",

The Modis platform has a daily passover frequency with a 1000m spatial resolution which makes it too coarse to provide detailed spatal data.  On the other hand, Landsat has a high spatial resolution of 30m, but the passover freuqncy is 1 in 8 days which makes it too infrequent to provide near-real-time data.  The Hydrosat algorithms combine Modis and Landsat data to produce a daily 20m spatial resolution \"fused\" land surface temperature (LST) product.
